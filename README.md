  4. To get the app prepared to run, in the terminal, run the command `npm i` to install dependencies.
  6. On (https://www.edamam.com/), sign up for a free API Key for adding to your .env files.
  5. Add a .env file in both the client and server folder. The server .env file should contain a `JWT=` secret password and the client .env file should contain a `REACT_APP_API_KEY=` and a `REACT_APP_API_ID=` which will require your personal API Key information.
